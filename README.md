## 😭 How to Get started?
Clone the repository to your local machine. 
<br>
When you have it cloned, you will need to do the following:

- Add your (OpenAI API Key)[https://openai.com/blog/openai-api] to a new `.env` file
```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY="Your OpenAI Key"
```

- Install the packages:
```bash
npm install
```
- Start the app:
```bash
npm run start
```

### If you need to build and serve the project on your hosting, run the following:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Testing

- Testing is done via `react jest`:
```bash
npm run test
```

**!ATTENTION!** Please read both .md files in the `docs/` directory BEFORE (and keep referring to it WHILE) working on the project. ***Code reviews*** will be done by me (Adil) and will be as brutal as it gets. To save yourself some time and headache, be sure to follow those guidelines.

## 📑 I'm stuck 
Me and everyone else in the team are more than welcome to help each other. However, it is agreed that you will spend some time researching the problem you are facing yourself before contacting someone for help. Most problems can be fixed in a span of an hour just by googling few things and reading some forums. But if you are ***really*** stuck, all of us are happy to help :)
