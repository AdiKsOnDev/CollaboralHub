# 🎨 ThinkLabs

Thinklabs is a collaboration platform created for artists, teachers, students and businesses to brainstorm new ideas and plan their execution.

## 🗃️ Folder Structure
```bash
|-- docs               <- Documentation
|-- src                <- Source
    |-- Assets         <- Images/Icons

```

## 😭 How to Get started?
Clone the repository to your local machine. 
(Note that you don't have to fork it.)
<br>
When you have it cloned, these are the following scripts you might need:
- Start the app:
```bash
npm run start
```

- Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

- Test the project:
```bash
npm run test
```

**!ATTENTION!** Please read both .md files in the `docs/` directory BEFORE (and keep referring to it WHILE) working on the project. ***Code reviews*** will be done by me (Adil) and will be as brutal as it gets. To save yourself some time and headache, be sure to follow those guidelines.

## 📑 I'm stuck 
Me and everyone else in the team are more than welcome to help each other. However, it is agreed that you will spend some time researching the problem you are facing yourself before contacting someone for help. Most problems can be fixed in a span of an hour just by googling few things and reading some forums. But if you are ***really*** stuck, all of us are happy to help :)
